# Lion Tinder

Yes.  That is correct.  A tinder for lions.

This simple demo app connects to a backend API (see my Lion Tinder API repo) and allows the user to swipe left or right on each picture, indicating their like or dislike of the picture.

Also, the user can upload new pictures from the pixabay API that will get saved to the back end API.

This is my first flutter mobile app, and it was fun to write.
